.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B OpenOCD
is an on\-chip debugging, in\-system programming and boundary\-scan
testing tool for ARM systems.
.PP 
The debugger uses an IEEE 1149\-1 compliant JTAG TAP bus master to access
on\-chip debug functionality available on ARM7/9, XScale, Cortex-M3, and
Marvell Feroceon (as found in the Orion SoC family) based
microcontrollers / system\-on\-chip solutions.
.PP 
User interaction is realized through a telnet command line interface and
a gdb (the GNU debugger) remote protocol server.
.PP 
OpenOCD supports various different types of JTAG interfaces/programmers,
please check the README for the complete list.
