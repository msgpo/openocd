The debugger uses an IEEE 1149-1 compliant JTAG TAP bus master to access on-chip
debug functionality available on ARM7 and ARM9 based microcontrollers /
system-on-chip solutions.

User interaction is realized through a telnet command line interface and a gdb
(The GNU Debugger) remote protocol server.

Initially, support for two JTAG TAP bus master interfaces with public hardware
schematics will be included, but support of additional hardware is an expressed
goal.

1. JTAG hardware

Currently, openocd contains support for Wiggler-compatible paralell port
dongles and a USB interface based on the FTDI FT2232, called USBJTAG-1.
A new version of the USB interface, USB-JTAG v1.2, is available with complete
schematics (http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~hhoegl/proj/volksmikro/usb-jtag/050910/).

It was tested using Amontec's (www.amontec.com) Chameleon POD in it's
Wiggler configuration, but homemade wigglers should work just as well.
In order to use the reset functionality (warm-reset, debug from reset, reset
and init), the choosen Wiggler has to connect the nSRST line.

USBJTAG-1 is based on a FTDI DLP2232M module and a few additional parts.
Schematics are freely available. USB-JTAG v1.2 doesn't use the DLP2232M, but
has the FTDI chip soldered directly on the PCB. There are two drivers for these
modules implemented, one using the open source libftdi, the other using FTDI's
proprietary FTD2XX library.

2. Supported cores

This version of openocd supports the following cores:

- ARM7TDMI
- ARM9TDMI

Support for cores with MMUs (ARM720t, ARM920t) is currently being merged.
