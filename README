The debugger uses an IEEE 1149-1 compliant JTAG TAP bus master to access on-chip
debug functionality available on ARM7 and ARM9 based microcontrollers /
system-on-chip solutions.

User interaction is realized through a telnet command line interface and a gdb
(The GNU Debugger) remote protocol server.

1. JTAG hardware

Currently, OpenOCD supports three types of JTAG interfaces:

- Parallel port wigglers. These devices connect to a PC's parallel port,
providing direct access to the JTAG lines. The OpenOCD contains descriptions
of a few Wiggler layouts, including the original 'Wiggler' design. Other
layouts (i.e. mapping of parallel port pins to JTAG lines) can be added easily.
Typical Wiggler speeds are around 12kByte/s code download to an ARM7's RAM.

- The Amontec JTAG Accelerator. This is a configuration for Amontec's Chameleon
dongle, a parallel port interface based on a Xilinx CoolRunner CPLD. It uses
the IEEE1284 EPP parallel port specification, providing many times the
performance achievable with wiggler-style devices. Additional information is
available on www.amontec.com.
Typical JTAG Accelerator speeds are around 120-160kByte/s to an ARM7's RAM.

- FTDI FT2232 based USB devices. The FT2232 (but not FT232 or FT245) features a
multi-protocol synchronous serial engine (MPSSE) that can be used to run the
serial JTAG protocol. There are several implemenations of FT2232 based devices:

* USBJTAG: http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~hhoegl/proj/usbjtag/usbjtag.html
The USBJTAG was designed by Prof. Hubert Hoegl to provide a high-speed USB
interface for use with the OpenOCD. Schematics are available at the USBJTAG
website, and a homebrew device can easily be built using the FTDI evaluation
module DLP2232M.

* OOCD-Link: http://www.joernonline.de/dw/doku.php?id=en:projects:oocdlink
Similar to the USBJTAG, this design comes with free schematics, too.

* Amontec JTAGkey: www.amontec.com
The Amontec JTAGkey offers support for a wide variety of target voltages from
1.4V to 5V. It also allows the JTAG lines and reset signals to be tri-stated,
allowing easy interfacing with a wide variety of targets.

* Amontec JTAGkey-Tiny: www.amontec.com
The Amontec JTAGkey offers support for a wide variety of target voltages from
2.8V to 5V. It also allows the reset signals to be tri-stated, allowing easy
interfacing with a wide variety of targets.

* Olimex ARM-USB-OCD: www.olimex.com
The Olimex ARM-USB-OCD offers support for a wide vriety of target voltages from
2.0V to 5V. It also allows targets to be powered from the ARM-USB-OCD and
features and additional RS232 UART.

* eVerve Signalyzer: www.signalyzer.com
The Signalyzer offers support for a wide variety of target voltages from 1.2V to
5.5V. A second connector provides access to a TTL level UART.

All FT2232 based devices may be accessed using either FTDI's proprietary FTD2XX
library (www.ftdichip.com) or using an open-source replacement from
http://www.intra2net.com/de/produkte/opensource/ftdi/index.php, also included
with many Linux distributions.

2. Supported cores

This version of openocd supports the following cores:

- ARM7TDMI(-s)
- ARM9TDMI
- ARM920t
- ARM922t
- ARM966e

Support for Intel XScale CPUs (PXA25x, PXA27x and IXP4xx) is currently being
developed.

3. Host platforms

OpenOCD was originally developed on x86-Linux, but has since then been ported
to run on Windows/Cygwin, native Windows with MinGW, FreeBSD, x86-64-Linux and
(though it's not fully working yet) PowerPC OS-X.

4. Documentation

Documentation for the OpenOCD is hosted in the Berlios OpenFacts Wiki at
