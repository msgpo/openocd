#Script for ZY1000

#Atmel ties SRST & TRST together, at which point it makes
#no sense to use TRST, but use TMS instead.
#
#The annoying thing with tying SRST & TRST together is that
#there is no way to halt the CPU *before and during* the
#SRST reset, which means that the CPU will run a number
#of cycles before it can be halted(as much as milliseconds).
