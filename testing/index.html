<h1>Testing</h1>
A test should be done on code committed to svn. Commit, then test. That way
one can know for sure *what* code was actually tested.
<h1>Release procedure</h1>
OpenOCD trunk is work in progress. Expect it to change daily and to have
some work in progress.
<p>
If you need the latest released and tested version, look for binary snapshots of
OpenOCD. Worst case look up the test result table below for the features
that are important to you and extract and build the version that has the right
cocktail of working features for you. You can also work with the community
to address the problems you are seing. Testing work and bug reports are
highly appreciated.
<p>
The OpenOCD community may decide to create release branches. If
this happens, then a branch will be created from OpenOCD trunk. The particular
version to create that branch might be an older version rather than the latest
and greatest. Fixes are then ported to that release branch from OpenOCD trunk.
<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>Passed version</td><td>The latest version on which the test is known to pass</td></tr>
<tr><td>Broken version</td><td>The latest version on which the test is known to fail. n/a when older than passed version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ID</td><td>A unqiue ID to refer to a test. The unique numbers are maintained in this file.</td></tr>

<h1>OpenOCD test results</h1>
These tests can be performed on any JTAG device as long
as they are executed using the unmodified code from SVN.
<p>
The latest version in which the test is known to have
passed is in the table below.
<table border=1>
	<tr><th>ID</th><th>Synopsis</th><th>Passed version</th><th>Broken version</th></tr>
	<tr><td>ocd1</td><td>Telnet Windows</td><td>291</td><td>n/a</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ocd2</td><td>Telnet Linux</td><td>291</td><td>n/a</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ocd3</td><td>Telnet Cygwin</td><td>291</td><td>n/a</td></tr>
	<tr><td><a href="#test_ocd4">ocd4</a></td><td>ARM7 debugging</td><td>291</td></tr>
	<tr><td>xscale1</a></td><td>XScale debugging</td><td>291</td></tr>
	<tr><td>xscale2</a></td><td>XScale MMU</td><td>291</td></tr>

<h1>OpenOCD JTAG device test results</h1>
Each JTAG device must be tested

<h1>Policy on removing features from OpenOCD</h1>
If a feature in OpenOCD is known to be broken and nobody has
submitted a fix and the feature is causing trouble for
maintainence, it can be removed from OpenOCD trunk. The threshold
for temporarily removing something from OpenOCD trunk is low to
ease maintainence and place the burden of maintainence on
those that care about a feature.
<p>
Note that code is never deleted from OpenOCD svn, it remains
in svn so if somebody sees a feature removed that they would
like kept, they have but to port and fix that feature
back up to main trunk. This document can be helpful in this
regard in that the latest working version and the known broken
version may be listed.
<h1>Policy on adding features from OpenOCD</h1>
To add a feature to OpenOCD, generally  it should not break any existing
features and it should be functional and the code reasonably readable
and useful to others in the OpenOCD community. The code does not
have to be completed. Work in progress is fine for OpenOCD trunk.
<p>
Also new tests should be defined. Note that the code does not have
to pass all the tests. In fact it can be helpful to have tests
to describe facets that really should be working, but aren't
done yet.

Connect to ARM7 device(any), use GDB load to load a program into RAM and single halt, resume and single step.
